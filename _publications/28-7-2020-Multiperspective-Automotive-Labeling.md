This [paper](https://akod0883.github.io/files/Multi_perspective_Automotive_Labeling.pdf) is about a new way to generate datasets for neural networks.

I also had the privilege to present this paper at the IPDPS [PAISE 2020](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/cfp/PAISE2020_COVID.html) workshop on Parallel AI and Systems for the Edge.
