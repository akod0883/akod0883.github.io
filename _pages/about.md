Hello future viewer of this website! My name is Akhil Kodumuri, and I am an upcoming Sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am interested in Artificial intelligence and general software engineering practices like Docker and Kubernetes. I also love Soccer (or futbol if your cultured). Go Barcelona FC and Manchester City! I am also a huge fan of comedy. I can spend hours studying, watching, and re-watching clips on Dave Champelle, David Dobrik, Akaash Singh, Hasan Minhaj, Joe Rogan, and Chris Rock standups. I'm also a huge DC and Marvel. It should be to no suprise that my favorite characters are Batman, Ironman, and Spider man. In a perfect world, I would like to become the next Ironman and help shape and save the world!

I have research experience in machine/deep learning, linux systems, Docker, and Kubernetes. I'm looking for any opportunities in AI and software. Generally, I love learning about new technologies and using them to world changing applications. 

Feel free to peruse this website to learn more about my interests, work, achievements, aspirations, and personality!
